I will make a new release by preforming the following procedures:

- [ ] Step1: Update version in pyproject.toml
- [ ] Step2: Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` with new change information
- [ ] Step3: Create release/tag at https://github.com/TUDelftGeodesy/sarxarray/releases

Hints:
- Step 1 and 2 can be done semi-automatically by calling agent skill in [release-changelog](.github/skills/release-changelog). However the changes will always be reviewed and commited by human.
