## Summary

Satellite-based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides invaluable image data for Earth observation. The Interferometric SAR (InSAR) technique, which utilizes a stack of SAR images in Single Look Complex (SLC) format, plays a significant role in various surface motion monitoring applications, e.g. civil-infrastructure stability [@chang2014detection; @chang2017railway], and hydrocarbons extraction [@fokker2016application; @ZHANG2022102847]. To facilitate advanced data processing for InSAR communities, we developed `SARXarray`, a Xarray extension for handling SLC SAR stacks. 

## Statement of Need

Satellite-based SAR generates data stacks with long temporal coverage, broad spatial coverage, and high spatio-temporal resolution. [@moreira2013tutorial] Handling SAR data stacks in an efficient way is a common challenge within InSAR communities. To address this challenge, High-Performance Computing (HPC) is often used to process data in a parallel and distributed manner. However, to fully leverage HPC capabilities, data processing workflows need to be customized for each specific use-case.

To facilitate efficient processing of SLC SAR stacks and minimize code customization, we developed `SARXarray` for SLC SAR stack. 

`SARXarray` leverages two well-established Python libraries `Xarray` and `Dask` from the [Pangeo community](https://www.pangeo.io/). It utilizes Xarrayâ€™s support on labeled multi-dimensional datasets to stress the space-time character of an SLC SAR stack. `Dask` is used to perform lazy evaluation of operations and block-wise computations. SARXarray can be integrated into existing Python workflows of InSAR processing and deployed on a variety of computational infrastructures. 

## Tutorial

We provided a tutorial as a Jupyter notebook to demonstrate the functionalities of `SARXarray`:

[Tutorial Jupyter notebook](https://tudelftgeodesy.github.io/sarxarray/notebooks/demo_sarxarray/)

The tutorial includes the following steps:

- Installation and data preparation
- Lazy loading a SAR data stack in binary format as an Xarray Dataset
- Attaching attributes to the loaded stack
- Applying common SAR operations on the loaded stack such as Multi-Looking and Mean-Reflection-Map
