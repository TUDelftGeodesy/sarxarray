abstract = {Upward migration of underground cavities can pose a major hazard for people and infrastructure. Either via sudden collapse sinkholes, or by eroding the support of building foundations, a migrating cavity can cause the collapse of buildings, water defense systems, or transport infrastructure. The main problem for risk assessment is the lack of a priori knowledge on the location of a potentially hazardous cavity. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of satellite radar interferometry to detect a migrating cavity under the city of Heerlen, the Netherlands, leading to foundation instability and the near-collapse of a part of a shopping mall in December 2011. We exploit the data archives of four imaging radar satellites, between 1992 and 2011, to investigate the dynamics of the area and detect shear strain within the structure of the building. Time series analysis shows localized differential vertical deformation rates of ~3mm/yr during 18years, followed by a dramatic increase of up to ~15mm/yr in the last few years. These results imply that the driving mechanism of the 2011 near-collapse event had a very long lead time and was likely due to a long-lasting gradual process, such as the upward migration of a cavity.}

abstract = {The Groningen gas field, the largest natural gas field in Europe, was discovered in 1959 and started its production in 1963. The Earth surface above it experienced subsidence over the past six decades because of gas extraction activities. To accurately reveal this surface movement with satellite SAR data, our study first proposes and demonstrates a model-backfeed (MBF) InSAR deformation estimation method to improve InSAR deformation time series modeling. This method allowed us to include a priori knowledge and to iteratively optimize functional and stochastic models. Using this method and employing a spatio-temporal SAR data integration method based upon Monte Carlo and Multiple Hypothesis Testing methods, we retrieved the 20-year subsidence history of the Groningen gas field by integrating 32 ERS-1/2, 68 Envisat and 82 Radarsat-2 SAR images. The results show that the maximum cumulative surface subsidence in this gas field has been as much as 15.5cm between 1995 and 2015. In terms of precision and accuracy, our MBF method offered a better result than the standard Multi-Temporal InSAR analysis method: the Ensemble Coherence increased by 10%–19% and Spatio-Temporal Consistency decreased by 2%–20%. In terms of accuracy, our results better concur with the external GNSS reference observations. We further show that the spatio-temporal SAR data integration method has better links with multi-platform SAR data if the uncertainties of the InSAR geolocation and temporal deformation are included. The study demonstrates that the MBF method optimized the estimation of deformation parameters and mitigated unwrapping errors.}
