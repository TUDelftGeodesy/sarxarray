# SarXarray

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/563781394.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/563781394)

`SarXarray` is an `Xarray` extension to process coregistered Single Look Complex (SLC) image stacks acquired by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). It utilizes `Xarray`â€™s support on labeled multi-dimensional datasets to stress the space-time character of the SLC SAR stack. It also takes the benefits from `Dask` to perform lazy evaluations of the operations.

## Installation

First, clone this repository to your local file system:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MotionbyLearning/sarxarray.git
```

It is strongly recommended to install `sarxarray` under an independent Python environment, e.g. an independent [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) environment. If `conda` is already installed in your system, you can create a new environment by:

```bash
conda create -n sarxarray_demo python=3.10
```

A new environment named `sarxarray_demo` will be created. Then you can activate it by:

```bash
conda activate sarxarray_demo
```

After creating a new environment, you can install `SarXarray` using `pip`:

```bash
cd sarxarray
pip install .
```

## Usage example

An [example Jupyter Notebook](examples/demo_sarxarray.ipynb) is available to demonstrate the usage of `SarXarray`. Please follow the instructions inside the notebook to excute the demo.
